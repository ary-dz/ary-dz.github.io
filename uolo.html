								<h3>About The Company</h4>
								<p>UOLO is an Indian company that focuses on providing technology-driven solutions for educational institutions. 
									They specialize in developing software and platforms that aim to enhance communication, collaboration, 
									and engagement between schools, parents, and students. UOLO offers a range of products and services, 
									including a school communication app, digital attendance systems, parent-teacher collaboration tools, 
									exam management platforms, and learning management systems. These solutions are designed to streamline 
									administrative tasks, facilitate effective communication, and support the overall learning experience in 
									schools.
								</p>
								<h3>My Role</h3>
								<p>
									During my internship at UOLO, I undertook the exciting task of developing a comprehensive timetable scheduling system 
									for schools. The objective was to create a user-friendly platform that enables schools to efficiently manage their 
									timetables while empowering teachers to personalize their own schedules. As part of the project, I had the creative 
									freedom to design the system according to my vision and add features beyond the initial requirements. One crucial 
									aspect was accommodating break times for teachers, as UOLO's main clients were Nursery to 5th-grade schools, which 
									often incorporate frequent breaks throughout the day. The resulting system allowed for the creation of multiple 
									timetables for different classes, as well as flexibility in generating multiple timetables for the same class.
								</p>
								<p>
									Timetable scheduling is a complex problem that requires a lot of computational power. Many institutions use graph 
									coloring to achieve a conflict free schedule, but usually you get one schedule. However, I wanted to give the user (intended to 
									be the school principal or administrator)
									the choice to select from multiple schedules. To achieve this, I used a genetic algorithm to generate multiple conflict-free
									solutions. The algorithm was able to generate multiple schedules in a matter of seconds. The user could then select the 
									best choice for their school.
								</p>
								<p>
									To achieve a responsive and interactive user interface, I employed Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, for the front-end 
									development. Vue.js allowed me to seamlessly create a dynamic user experience that adapts to different screen sizes. 
									To handle data exchange between the front-end and back-end, I utilized Axios, a versatile JavaScript library for making 
									HTTP requests.
								</p>
								<p>
									For the back-end, I opted for Flask, a Python-based server framework renowned for its simplicity and flexibility, 
									to build a robust RESTful API. Flask empowered me to handle the logic and data management effectively, ensuring 
									seamless communication between the front-end and the database. By leveraging the strengths of these frameworks 
									and technologies, I successfully created a user-friendly and efficient timetable scheduling system for schools, 
									meeting the specific needs and requirements of UOLO and its clientele.
								</p>
								<p>
									I made a strategic decision to utilize Python as the primary language for the project. Python's exceptional data 
									parsing capabilities made it an ideal choice, allowing me to efficiently process and manipulate the complex data 
									involved in creating and managing timetables.
								</p>
								<p>
									To future-proof the system and provide flexibility, I incorporated a feature that enabled users to upload their 
									configurations as files. This design choice allowed schools to customize their scheduling preferences and easily 
									adapt the system to their unique requirements. By allowing users to run the timetable generator using their uploaded 
									configurations, the system provided a seamless and user-friendly experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									All of this secured a high level of adaptability and robustness, meeting the dynamic needs of schools and ensuring 
									long-term usability.
